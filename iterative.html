    <!-- What Is Explanation -->
    <div class = "section-header"> What Is Iterative Design? </div>
    <div class = "section-content">
      Iterative design is a design process where products undergo multiple
      cycles of prototyping, testing, and redesign based on the results of
      that testing.
    </div>

    <!-- Project Goal -->
    <div class = "section">
    <div class = "section-header"> Project Goal </div>
    <div class = "section-content">
      The goal of this group project was to develop a prototype based on a description of our
      chosen startup without looking at their actual website. In the process of designing an interface
      from scratch, our team learned a great deal about collaborative design, user testing and
      giving constructive feedback.
    </div>

    <!-- Start Up Chosen-->
    <div class = "section-header"> Startup Chosen </div>
    <div class = "section-content"> Welcome to Mesh, a social networking site for remote companies! It allows employees to share the projects they are working on, explore other people's projects, and give each other feedback. </div>

    <!-- Sketches -->
    <div class = "section-header"> Sketches </div>
    <div class = section-content> We started by brainstorming 4 possible designs for Mesh's desktop app. </div>

    <!-- Lo-fi Wireframes -->
    <div class = "section-header"> Lo-Fi Wireframes </div>
    <div class = "section-content"> We took ideas from each of our sketches, and combined them into a single set of wireframes. We felt that the card-based dashboard clearly showed the user's current projects, while the tree structure was a good representation of all projects in the system. We also thought it was important for a project to have its own page and for there to be a page where users could submit feedback for another project. </div>

    <div class = "section-subheader"> Critique and Adjustments </div>
    <div class = "section-content"> 
      We received some valuable critique feedback and we revised our prototype accordingly.
      <ul> 
        <li> Text hierarchy (changed boldness, used one typeface)  </li>
        <li> Dashboard icons (made notifications vs members clear) </li>
        <li> Project relationship (added parent project selection for the tree logic </li>
        <li> Unclear login page (added section describing Mesh) </li>
        <li> Unclear tree purpose (added text to indicate circles represent project hierarchy) </li>
        <li> Some lack of clarity in navigation (made buttons match the pages they go to, added breadcrumbs) </li>

    <!-- User Testing -->
    <div class = "section-header"> User Testing </div>
    <div class= "section-content"> 
      Using our interactive prototype, we conducted a usability test through a remote user testing service. Since the primary functionality of our app is to share project updates and to give feedback, we instructed the users to complete the following tasks and gathered user testing videos from the service.

    <!-- Results -->
    <div class = "section-subheader"> Results  </div>
    <div class= "section-content">
      Going into user testing, we expected it to be pretty straightforward for users to
      create a new project and open a project to feedback. We were curious to find out whether
      users could find other people's projects on our project tree and expected there to
      possibly be some confusion around the explore page.

    <div class = "section-content">
      <ul>
        <li> The first user made no errors in tasks, did tasks pretty quickly but had trouble differentiating between own and others' projects </li>
        <li> The second user tried to click the member circles from "My Project" page in order to go to other projects </li>
        <li> All users had trouble finding the "Explore" page, they did not know that that would lead to seeing all possible projects </li>
        <li> Users did not know what were "their projects" or "other people's projects". They did not instinctively click on the "i" in order to view the key </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Potential Changes -->
    <div class = "section-header"> Potential Changes </div>
    <div class = "section-content">
      Based on our feedback from user testing, we came up with potential changes to improve our design:
      <ul>
        <li> Change header label from "explore" to "all projects" </li>
        <li> Make key for projects tree onscreen or make the info button open by default to make sure people know how the project tree works </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class = "section-header"> Conclusion </div>
    <div class = "section-content"> All in all, this was a fascinating, informative, and enjoyable project. Ideating, designing, and prototyping a web-based application was a challenging, yet incredibly rewarding process; our team learned a great deal about collaborative design, iterative prototyping, and user testing, and developed skills which will accompany us in all future projects. </div>
