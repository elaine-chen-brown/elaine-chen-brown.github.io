    <!-- What Is Explanation -->
    <div class = "section-header"> What Is React? </div>
    <div class = "section-content">
      React is an open-source JavaScript library used to dynamically
      render webpages. It operates on a component model, where components
      store data in their state and pass data to one another through
      function calls and upon instantiation.
    </div>

    <!-- Project Goal -->
    <div class = "section-header"> Project Goal </div>
    <div class = "section-content">
      The goal of this project was to create a list interface using
      React that supports filtering, sorting, and aggregation. I chose
      to make a virtual bookshelf application, where a user can filter
      books by genre and author, sort by publication date, and see
      the total word count of the books they have selected.
    </div>


    <!-- Usability Principles Used -->
    <div class = "section-header"> Usability Principles </div>
    <div class = "section-content"> 
      When designing my site, I considered Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics:
      <ul>
        <li> Visibility of System Status
          <ul>
            <li> Users can see which books have been added to the total word count </li>
            <li>
              Users are shown an alert window when they add or remove books from 
              their total word count list
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Match Between System and Real World
          <ul>
            <li> 
              Filters mimic a user's conceptual model  of a bookstore or library:
              one first goes to a specific genre or author
              and then views books sorted alphabetically by title
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> User Control and Freedom
          <ul>
            <li> Users can both add and remove books from the total word count section </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Consistency and Standards
          <ul>
            <li>
              The total word count section is referred to as "Books List"
              every time it is referenced.
            </li>
            <li> Filter labels match the labels shown on the books in the grid </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
          <ul>
            <li> Users can undo filters by clicking "All" </li>
            <li> Users can undo adding a book to their books list by clicking "Remove from Books List" </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Error Prevention
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users are prevented from selecting multiple authors or genres at once,
              since a book cannot have more than one author and main genre
            </li>
            <li>
              Users are prevented from adding a book to their total word count list
              more than once and are shown an error message if they try to do so
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Recognition Rather than Recall
          <ul>
            <li> The filter bar is clearly visible to the user </li>
            <li> 
              The "Add to Books List" and "Remove from Books List" buttons are clearly
              displayed
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
          <ul>
            <li>
              A user can either filter for exactly which genre and/or author's books
              they want to see or explore all the books available by scrolling through
              the grid
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
          <ul>
            <li> Only neccessary text is shown, and every piece of text has a purpose </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Help and Documentation
          <ul>
            <li>
              While no instructions section is provided, button and filter labels are
              imperative calls to action that tell the user their task
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
