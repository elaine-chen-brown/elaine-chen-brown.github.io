    <!-- What Is Explanation -->
    <div class = "section-header"> What Is A/B Testing? </div>
    <div class = "section-content">
      A/B testing is a method for UI research, where a small group of users
      are shown a different version of a product and asked to interact with it.
      Data is collected about their interactions, and the results are analyzed
      to see whether the changes made from the original version had any
      statistically significant impact on user behavior.
    </div>

    <!-- Project Goal -->
    <div class = "section">
      <div class = "section-header"> Project Goal </div>
      <div class = "section-content"> 
        The goal of this project was to create null and alternative hypotheses
        for the time to completion and return rate for two variations of a website,
        collect data through an A/B test, and perform a statistical analysis
        on this data to either reject or not reject our initial hypotheses.
        <br>
        <br>
        For my two website variations, I used version A as a control, following the
        layout provided in the stencil code. I then used version B as a variation,
        changing its layout to a grid with defined item separators and changing the
        text on the buttton to say "Pick Me!" instead of "Adopt!".
        <br>
        <br>
        The two versions were tested for time to completion and return rate on a
        group of users tasked with filling their carts with $150 worth of kittens.

      <div class = "section-header"> Hypotheses </div>
      <div class = "section-subheader"> Time To Completion </div>
      <div class = "section-content"> 
        I hypothesized that my variation on the control --using a grid layout and "Pick Me!" button-- would lead to
        a lower time to completion because users would not have to scroll down to 
        see more item options and would be feel a sense of urgency and personal
        connection to the task at hand.
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class = "special">
        My null hypothesis is that my variation on the control will not lead to a lower time to
        completion.

      <br>
      <div class = "section-subheader"> Return Rate </div>
      <div class = "section-content"> 
        I hypothesized that my variation on the control --using a grid layout and "Pick Me!" button-- would lead to
        a lower return rate because users would be able to fill up their carts to
        $150 on the first try and would not need to return to the cart-filling page
        to do so. They could also be compelled to add more items to their carts the
        first time around due to the button text's personal appeal.
        <br>

        Myy null hypothesis is that my variation on the control will not lead to a lower return rate.

      <div class = "section-header"> Process </div>
      <div class = "section-content"> 
        To collect my data, I had a group of anonymous users access my website through
        a link, which yielded a 50% chance of showing them version A and a 50% chance of
        showing them version B. They were then asked to interact with the site by filling
        their carts up with at least $150 worth of items. I was then able to get the
        timestamp data of each user's interaction with my site through Heroku's logs,
        which records page loads and button presses, and compute each user's time to completion
        and whether or not they returned.
        <br>
        <br>
        In total, I collected relevant data from 22 users, 12 of whom interacted with version
        A and 10 of whom interacted with version B.

        Although my statistical tests produced inconclusive results, I was able to learn some
        broad takeaways on A/B testing in general:
        <ul>
          <li> Sample size could be a limitation on testing.
            <ul>
              <li> My study only had 22 participants. A larger sample size might have yielded
                significant results.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Participant environment could be a limitation on testing.
            <ul>
              <li> All users in my study are enrolled in CS1300 and completed their tasks
                during studio time. This does not accurately reflect the conditions under which
                an actual user accesses a shopping website, where they would probably go in
                with a mindset of exploration and take much longer weighing options before
                adding them to their cart.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Other design principles could make a bigger impact on time to completion and
            return rate than layout.
            <ul>
              <li> My study showed no significant difference between a single column layout and
                a defined grid layout in terms of time to completion and return rate.
              </li>
